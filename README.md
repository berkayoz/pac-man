# pac-man
Basic pac-man game without ghosts made with Object C

There is 72 food on the map, the game completes after you eat them all.
This game was made for a lesson project so it is kind of basic.
I didn't have enough time to code AI so i didnt include ghosts in the game.
The game needs to be compiled on Turbo C++.

Game Controls:
W-Upwards
S-Downwards
A-Left
